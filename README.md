# Hotel_Management_System
Java Maven PostgreSQL JDBC

The hotel Management System is a console-based application built using Core Java, JDBC, and PostgreSQL. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for customer records stored in a PostgreSQL database. The application is menu-driven to , providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing customer data for management c.

Features for customer : Added a new customer record to the database forThese are used by DriverManager.getConnection() to establish a connection to the database. Updating: Update an existing customers 's details (like that adharno,address,adharno,mobile no). Delete: Delete an customer record by ID. Menu-Driven Interface: Easy-to-use console-based menu for seamless navigation. Use Collectios For retrive all customer list. Technologies Used Core Java: For implementing the application logic and OOPs concepts. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting to and interacting with the PostgreSQL database. PostgreSQL: For storing and managing customer data and details. Maven: For project dependency management and building the project. 

PostgreSQL JDBC Driver: For connecting to the PostgreSQL database. org.postgresql postgresql 42.6.0 Prerequisites Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher. Apache Maven 3.8.6 or higher. PostgreSQL 15 or higher. create PostgreSQL database with the following table: CREATE TABLE customersdetails (  postidentity,ressidensial address null details); Contact For any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out:A hotel management system project can be implemented using a Spring Boot REST API with an Angular frontend and a PostgreSQL database, adhering to the MVC architecture. 


Backend (Spring Boot - MVC Architecture): 

• Model: 
	• Entities: Create JPA entities (e.g., Room, Guest, Booking, Employee, Service) mapped to PostgreSQL tables. Define relationships (e.g., one-to-many between Room and Booking).
 
	• Repositories: Define Spring Data JPA repositories (e.g., RoomRepository, GuestRepository) to interact with the database, providing CRUD operations. 

• View: In a REST API context, the "view" is the data representation (JSON/XML) returned by the controllers. Spring Boot handles this automatically when using @RestController. 

• Controller: 
	• REST Controllers: Create Spring @RestController classes (e.g., RoomController, BookingController) to expose RESTful endpoints for managing hotel data. 
	• Service Layer: Introduce a service layer (e.g., RoomService, BookingService) between controllers and repositories to encapsulate business logic, promote reusability, and maintain a clean separation of concerns. 
 

Frontend (Angular - Responsive UI): 
• Components: Develop Angular components for different parts of the UI (e.g., RoomListComponent, BookingFormComponent, GuestDetailsComponent). 
• Services: Create Angular services to handle HTTP requests to the Spring Boot REST API, fetching and sending data. 
• Routing: Implement Angular routing to navigate between different views/components. 
• Responsiveness: Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Angular Material to ensure the UI adapts to various screen sizes. 


Integration: 
• CORS Configuration: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the Spring Boot application to allow the Angular frontend to make requests to the backend. 
• HTTP Requests: The Angular services will use HttpClient to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the corresponding Spring Boot REST API endpoints. 
• Data Exchange: Data will be exchanged between the frontend and backend primarily in JSON format. 

Hotel Management System Project Ideas: 

• Room Management: Add/edit/delete rooms, view room availability, assign room types.
• Guest Management: Register/manage guest details, view guest history. 
• Booking Management: Create/cancel bookings, search bookings by guest or room, manage check-in/check-out. 
• Employee Management: Manage staff details, assign roles and permissions. 
• Service Management: Offer and track various hotel services (e.g., laundry, room service). 
• Billing and Invoicing: Generate invoices, manage payments. 
• Reporting: Generate reports on occupancy, revenue, guest statistics. 
• Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure login and role-based access control using Spring Security and JWT.
